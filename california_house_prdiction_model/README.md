In this project, I am trying to creatre a model that can predict the price of the house when certain information is provided about the house(like Longitude, Latitude, Total rooms, Total bedrooms, Median income, Ocean proximation etc.) where the Median income is the most important data, which affects the maximum in determining the price of house.

The dataset used in this model is named as " Housing.csv".

All columns used in this dataset and their type is given below:
  columns                             datatype
1. longitude            ----          float64
2. latitude             ----          float64
3. housing_median_age   ----          float64
4. total_rooms          ----          float64
5. total_bedrooms       ----          float64
6. population           ----          float64
7. households           ----          float64
8. median_income        ----          float64
9. median_house_value   ----          float64
10. ocean_proximity     ----           object
    
This dataset contains total '20640' entries.

Then we apply some Datacleaning and Data Transformation Techniques in our Dataset
