In this project, I am trying to creatre a model that can predict the price of the house when certain information is provided about the house(like area_type, availability, size, total_sqft, balcony, price etc.) where the total_sqft and size are the most important data, which affects the maximum in determining the price of house.

The dataset used in this model is named as " Bengaluru_House_Data.csv".

All columns used in this dataset and their type is given below: columns datatype
  columns                         dtype
1. area_type            ----      object 
2. availability         ----      object 
3. location             ----      object 
4. size                 ----      object 
5. society              ----      object 
6. total_sqft           ----      object 
7. bath                 ----      float64
8. balcony              ----      float64
9. price                ----      float64

This dataset contains total "13320" entries.

Then we apply some Datacleaning and Data Transformation Techniques in our Dataset

And this is our final product demonstrating the amt of the house in Indra Nagar
