In this project, I am trying to creatre a model that can predict the price of the house when certain information is provided about the house(like area_type, availability, size, total_sqft, balcony, price etc.) where the total_sqft and size are the most important data, which affects the maximum in determining the price of house.

The dataset used in this model is named as " Bengaluru_House_Data.csv".

All columns used in this dataset and their type is given below: columns datatype
  columns                         dtype
1. area_type                      object 
2. availability                   object 
3. location                       object 
4. size                           object 
5. society                        object 
6. total_sqft                     object 
7. bath                           float64
8. balcony                        float64
9. price                          float64

This dataset contains total "13320" entries.

Then we apply some Datacleaning and Data Transformation Techniques in our Dataset
